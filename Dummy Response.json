            "analysis": "\nThe query you provided, \"Missing policy details in Kafka response for Policy Lookup Service\", matches a relevant defect in the dataset. Here is a detailed root cause analysis and step-by-step solutions to fix the issue:\n\nRoot Cause Analysis:\n1. The issue occurred because of a missing field mapping between the MongoDB document schema and the Kafka producer's payload format.\n2. The policy number field was not included in the Kafka message, causing downstream systems to fail when trying to retrieve policy details.\n3. The error log from the Kafka consumer indicated that the policy number was not found in the payload.\n4. The Kafka payload XML file showed that the policy ID was included, but the policy number field was missing.\n\nComprehensive Solutions:\n1. Update the MongoDB query to include the policy number in the query. This will ensure that the policy number field is retrieved from the MongoDB database and included in the Kafka message.\n2. Modify the Kafka producer logic to map the policy number field properly. This will ensure that the policy number field is included in the Kafka message and can be consumed by downstream systems.\n3. Test the changes in a QA environment with multiple policy scenarios to ensure that the fix works as expected.\n4. Try different cases and fix any bugs that are encountered during testing.\n5. Deploy the fix in the production environment, checking logs beforehand for any issues.\n6. Continue to monitor the system closely to ensure that the fix is working as expected and that no new issues are introduced.\n\nIf you face any doubts or roadblocks while implementing the solution, you can reach out to John Doe, the previous owner of the defect, for further assistance. They can provide valuable insights and guidance to help you resolve the issue.\n"
