    "solution": "The MongoDB query updated to include policy number in the query. Kafka producer logic modified so it maps the policy number field properly. Then tested the changes in QA environment with multiple policy scenario. We also tried different cases and fixed bugs on the way. After that, we deploy the fix in production enviorment, checking logs before hand for any issue. There was no issue found and now data flow fine, but we continue monitor closely.",
